# Inquiry Project

#### Concept:
Inquiry is a full-stack web application that blends social media, AI chatbot integration, competition, and Q&A into a Mafia-like format.

#### Core Mechanics:
1.	Users post open-ended questions.
2.	Users are randomly assigned roles daily:
	- Citizens → Must answer the question themselves.
	- Imposters → Must prompt AI to generate their answer.
3.	All responses (human and AI) are posted anonymously.
4.	Users can like questions and comments.
5.	If a question reaches a time threshold, it closes.
6.	The most-liked comment wins.
	- The comment’s author gains points.
